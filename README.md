<br>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [consulta_academica][consulta_academica], [PingPOMDP][ping_pomdp] and [finishing college][curriculum].
<!-- - ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust -->

<!-- 
- I'm a data enthusiast, [almost computer scientist][curriculum], [undergrad researcher][research].
- I use Fedora btw (I may or may not have an alias to restart pipewire...)
- You're very welcome to reach out!  -->

<details> <summary> Some of the Things Iâ€™ve Done </summary>

- [AcaDem][academ]: **python** and **SQL** script to extract and process my college's students data.
- [Undergrad research][research]: on **Data Science** theoretical and practical foundations.
- [Introds][introds]: Introduction to Data Science **summer course** I've organized and taught at my college following [R for data science][r4ds].
- [Timetabling][timetabling]: group project for the **Software Testing** class where I've designed the archtecture using **FastAPI**, implemented the models and controllers, as well as the **unit tests** and the github actions **workflows** for testing.    
- [case-basedosdados][basedados]: **dataviz** case to explore **BigQuery** and **basedosdados**'s **API**.
- [ChitChat][chitchat]: created a protocol and three architectures to implement a simple chat and learn about Sockets, RPC, P2P, networks and distributed systems.
- [dlox][dlox]: my following of the awesome [Crafting Interpreters][crafting_interpreters] to learn more about **compilers**.
- The classics: implemented some of the **classical algorithms** and **data structures** such as [quicksort][quicksort], [huffman code][huffman], [hashing][hashing] and [simulated annealing][sim_annealing] for the TSP. 
- Solved some fun exercisms to learn [Elixir][elixir_exercism] and [Rust][rust_exercism].
- Wrote ["IntroduÃ§Ã£o Ã  Linguagem Julia"][julia] a short introductory book on Julia Language.
- Built and documented a [CRUD][niex] to an imaginary supermarket with **ruby on rails**, **docker** and **postgres** to learn the basics of webdev.
- Created a simple [calculator][calculator] and a [Tic Tac Toe][tictactoe] using React to gain a better understanding of JavaScript and functional programming within the context of building interactive web applications.

<details><summary> Some of the Things I Love </summary>
  
  - <details><summary> "Outstanding communication" </summary>
  
    - "Outstanding communication" is the term I use to describe exceptional communicative pieces, as the name suggests. 
    - It can be any type of medium, any type of message, anything that catches my attention for its efficiency and functionality of communication.
    - <details><summary> I have a <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOyYWXM6fk1aPdjrU-C4ZG-UgF0RDf5ES"> youtube playlist </a> to collect such pieces, take a look at some of them! </summary>

    To quote the [ultimate authority on the subject][abok] (emphasis added):

    > To me the simple act of tying a knot is **an adventure in unlimited space**. A bit of string affords a dimensional latitude that is **unique among the entities**.
    > 

    > For an uncomplicated strand is a palpable object that, for all practical purposes, possesses one dimension only. If we move a single strand in a plane, interlacing it at will, actual **objects of beauty and of utility can result** in what is practically two dimensions; and if we choose to direct our strand out of this one plane, another dimension is added which provides opportunity for **an excursion that is limited only by the scope of our own imagery and the length of the ropemakerâ€™s coil**.
