## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a data enthusiast, almost computer scientist, [undergrad researcher](https://github.com/dbs-97/ds_fundamentals_research).
- I use Fedora btw (I may or may not have an alias to restart pipewire ...)

### Some things I've done
- [AcaDem](https://github.com/dbs-97/demanda_academica): python script to extract and process student data at my college
- [case-basedosdados](https://github.com/dbs-97/case-basedosdados): Dataviz case to explore BigQuery and basedosdados's API. 
- Implemented some of the classical algorithms and data structures such as [quicksort](https://github.com/dbs-97/DataStructures2/blob/main/sorting_algorithms.py), [huffman code](https://github.com/dbs-97/Estrutura_Dados/blob/main/LE3/LE3.ipynb) and [simulated annealing](https://github.com/dbs-97/heuristics/blob/main/heuristics_a2.ipynb) for the TSP 
- Played with [sockts and RPC](https://github.com/dbs-97/sistdist#daniel-brito) to implement a chat and learn about networks and distributed systems
- Read the awesome [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/dbs-97/dlox) to learn about compilers
- Solved some fun [Elixir exercisms](https://github.com/dbs-97/exercism_elixir) 
- Created and taught an introductory [summer course](https://github.com/dbs-97/introds) on data science
- Wrote a small book on [Julia Language](https://github.com/dbs-97/julia_book)
- Build and documented an [CRUD](https://github.com/dbs-97/niex) to a imaginary supermarket with ruby on rails, docker and postgress to learn the basics of webdev
- Made a simple [calculator](https://github.com/dbs-97/calculator) with react 

Feel free to reach out!
