## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I'm a data enthusiast, almost computer scientist, [undergrad researcher][research].
- I use Fedora btw (I may or may not have an alias to restart pipewire...)
- You're very welcome to reach out! 

### Some things I've done
- [AcaDem][academ]: python script to extract and process my college's students data.
- [Introds][introds]: created and taught an Introduction to Data Science summer course at my college.
- [case-basedosdados][basedados]: dataviz case to explore BigQuery and basedosdados's API.
- [ChitChat][chitchat]: created a protocol and three architectures to implement a simple chat and learn about Sockets, RPC, P2P, networks and distributed systems.
- [dlox][dlox]: my following of the awesome [Crafting Interpreters][crafting_interpreters] to learn more about compilers.
- The classics: implemented some of the classical algorithms and data structures such as [quicksort][quicksort], [huffman code][huffman], [hashing][hashing] and [simulated annealing][sim_annealing] for the TSP. 
- Solved some fun [Elixir exercisms][elixir_exercism].
- Wrote a small book on [Julia Language][julia].
- Built and documented a [CRUD][niex] to an imaginary supermarket with ruby on rails, docker and postgres to learn the basics of webdev.
- Created a simple [calculator][calculator] and a [Tic Tac Toe][tictactoe] using React to gain a better understanding of JavaScript and functional programming within the context of building interactive web applications.
